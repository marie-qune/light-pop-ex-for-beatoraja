# light-pop-for-beatoraja
Basically [light pop ex](https://mistyblue.info/lpex.html), with some fixes for beatoraja.

* [x] laser display based on judge (only available on wide(16:9) ver)
* [ ] judge display fix
* [ ] gauge display fix
* [ ] exhard style gauge
* [ ] fast/slow display
* [ ] (maybe) upscale image source for better display on 1080p
* and so on...


This project is still under development, but you could give it a try by copying this folder to beatoraja's skin folder.
