# light-pop-for-beatoraja
Basically [light pop ex](https://mistyblue.info/lpex.html), with some fixes for beatoraja.

* [x] laser display based on judge (only available on wide(16:9) ver)
* [x] judge counter display fix
* [x] gauge display fix
* [ ] exhard style gauge
* [x] fast/slow display (but the design is a bit weird now)
* [ ] (maybe) upscale image source for better display on 1080p
* and so on...

### Known issues
* [ ] gauge background display("Groove Gauge -----------------") is a bit weird due to the different gauge system of beatoraja/LR2
* [ ] hard gauge background should not show "Groove Gauge -----------------"


This project is still under development, but you could give it a try by copying this folder to beatoraja's skin folder.
